# chessClock
A chess clock app.

the [main](https://github.com/MansoorCM/chessClock/blob/master/main.jpg) screen shows the clock for both the players and clicking 
on one clock starts the other player's timer.
when a running clock is pressed, the timer stops and the opponents time starts as shown in the [screen](https://github.com/MansoorCM/chessClock/blob/master/play.jpg). 
when one of the player runs out of time, he loses the game and the [flag screen](https://github.com/MansoorCM/chessClock/blob/master/flag.jpg) 
is shown.
the [settings page](https://github.com/MansoorCM/chessClock/blob/master/timecontrol.jpg) contains some predefined time controls and allows the user
to insert new time controls using this [page]https://github.com/MansoorCM/chessClock/blob/master/newtimecontrol.jpg. it also allows the user to 
[update](https://github.com/MansoorCM/chessClock/blob/master/updatetime.jpg) and delete the existing time controls.
